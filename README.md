# ChargedParticles-1.0
A python 2D physics simulation, using pygame, of many particles with mass and electric charge in a box.

This version includes downward gravity acceleration, elastic collisions based (Currently Discrete), and coulomb force (might change/improve that later). Each two particles interaction is calculated after "Sweep and Prune" algorithm, to avoid unnecessary calculations.
