# ChargedParticles-1.0
A python physics simulation, using pygame, of many particles wih mass and electric charge.

This version includes downward gravity acceleration, elastic collisions based (Currently Discrete), and coulomb force (might change/improve that later). Each two particles interaction is calculated after "Sweep and Prune" algorithm, to avoid unnecessary calculations.
